# Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Heart Disease

## Objective

To perform predictions to identify patients with a high risk of developing heart disease through utilization of various machine learning models as well as to speed up the diagnostic process based on the medical information provided, hence allowing for early preventive measures.

## Background

The prevalence of heart disease, a general term referring to several types of heart conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States, causing about 1 in every 5 deaths and posing a significant threat to public health.

Early detection and intervention can significantly decrease the risk of heart disease, promoting better quality of life and reducing heart disease-related mortality.

## Data

The [Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) dataset is provided by the **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository**, containing combined data from the Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and VA Long Beach databases.

Contains data from 920 patients. Features: 14 of 76 variables are available for public use, encompassing demographic information, physiological measurements, and patient medical history. Outcome variable: 1 in total, indicating the presense of heart disease.
